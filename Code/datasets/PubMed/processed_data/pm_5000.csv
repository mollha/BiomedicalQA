Faecal ammonia and pH during lactulose administration in man: comparison with other cathartics. The effect of lactulose on faecal pH and ammonia has been studied in three normal subjects with the aid of dialysis of faeces in vivo. Observations were also made with sodium sulphate and the two hexahydric alcohols, mannitol and sorbitol, given in doses sufficient to cause a similar increase in stool weight. All four cathartics rendered the stool more acid, but there was no increase in the concentration of faecal ammonia. Lactulose, despite increasing faecal volume, did not cause an increase in the absolute amount of ammonia lost in the faeces, but the other purgatives did show a modest rise. The results are inconsistent with the theory that lactulose benefits the clinical picture of portosystemic encephalopathy by trapping ammonia in an acid stool. An alternative suggestion is advanced, namely, that any cathartic (including lactulose) reduces ammonia absorption from the colon by decreasing colonic transit time, and so reducing the amount of ammonia generated by autolysis of colonic bacteria.
The effect of vagotomy on gastric adaptation. Gastric adaptation was impaired immediately after the performance of complete vagotomy in a series of 20 acute experiments in the dog. Preliminary isolation of the intact vagi in 10 of these animals produced alterations in adaptation similar to those seen after vagal division. It is concluded that alterations in gastric adaptation are not a reliable intraoperative aid to complete vagotomy. These findings may be significant in the interpretation of all intraoperative tests for vagotomy.
The absorption and secretion of water and electrolytes across the healthy and the diseased human colonic mucosa measured in vitro. An ;in-vitro' technique is described for measuring quantitatively the absorption and secretion of water and electrolytes, the short circuiting current, and the simultaneous bidirectional flux rates of ions across the healthy and diseased colonic mucosa. The results show that the normal colon absorbs both sodium and water and secretes potassium. In both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease there is a reversal of sodium and water flux and potassium secretion is increased.A measure of the simultaneous bidirectional flux rates under conditions of zero potential has allowed us to use the Ussing equation to analyse some of the factors involved in sodium transport across the healthy and diseased mucosa.
Enterokinase in normal intestinal biopsies and those from patients with untreated coeliac disease. Enterokinase was measured in peroral intestinal biopsies showing normal histology and in those from untreated coeliac patients which showed gross villous atrophy. There was no significant difference in the specific activity of enterokinase between these two groups. These results do not support the recent hypothesis that enterokinase is a brush border enzyme, but would be consistent with the idea that it is adsorbed to the cell membrane following secretion.
Reaginic hypersensitivity in ulcerative colitis. Reaginic hypersensitivity in ulcerative colitis has been investigated in respect of a hypersensitivity to the cow's milk proteins and the frequency of atopic asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Intradermal tests were frequently positive, especially to casein, but the results did not differ from those found in healthy individuals and in groups of patients with Crohn's disease, hypolactasia, and the irritable colon syndrome. No circulating IgE-specific antibodies to the milk proteins were found. An increased frequency of atopic diseases was found in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (15.7%) and Crohn's disease (13.3%) compared with the findings in a control group (1.2%). It is concluded that, if an allergy to milk proteins is a factor in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, it is not mediated by reaginic antibodies. It is possible, however, that the frequent occurrence of atopy indicates a susceptibility to develop reaginic responses even though this mechanism does not apply to the milk proteins.
The homeostatic function of the colon in acute gastroenteritis. Infants and young children with acute gastroenteritis have been studied with regard to stool electrolyte composition, external electrolyte balance, and aldosterone excretion. At the height of fluid depletion the stool sodium concentrations are low (median 8 m-equiv/1, range 3-58 m-equiv/1). The results indicate that in gastroenteritis the colon is responding homeostatically to a state of secondary hyperaldosteronism, thus assisting in sodium conservation.
Isolation of a mycoplasma from sarcoid tissue. Using a modified cell-free culture medium, a mycoplasma was isolated from sarcoid lymph nodes in two cases and from sarcoid skin lesions in four out of seven cases of chronic sarcoidosis. Growth inhibition tests showed that the isolates were related to Mycoplasma orale type 1. By the indirect haemagglutination method, 244 cases of definite or probable sarcoidosis, 160 patients with other diseases, and 355 blood donors were tested for antibodies against an isolated mycoplasma (strain 215-M). Titres [unk] 16 were found in 14% of the patients with sarcoidosis and in 8% of the patients with other diseases but only in 0.6% of the blood donors. The proportion of patients with high antibody titres among those with sarcoidosis and erythema nodosum was smaller (8%) than among those with other forms of sarcoidosis (17%). The role of the mycoplasmas isolated from sarcoid tissues remains obscure, but it is possible that these organisms are only an expression of altered immunity in sarcoidosis.
Changes in the normal range of thyroidal radioiodine uptake. Three series of patients shown to be euthyroid but originally referred for thyroid uptake tests in vivo have been compared. In 1958-59, the ;normal' mean thyroid uptake was 23.5% and 38.2% respectively at four and 24 hours. By 1967, the mean uptakes had dropped to 20.4% and 31.6%-a significant change at both times. By 1972 there was, however, no sign of a further reduction of the mean normal values for thyroid uptake. These results are compared with changes observed in other series in the USA and elsewhere.
Liver morphology in acute viral hepatitis related to the hepatitis B antigen. The liver histology in infectious hepatitis or hepatitis A (HA) and serum hepatitis or hepatitis B (HB) is generally described as identical. However, the clinical separation of the two types has been a problem. Today a serological reaction based on the well documented association between hepatitis antigen and HB is of great assistance in the differential diagnosis. The present study of 165 hepatitis cases separated into hepatitis A and B by this test method indicates quantitative differences in the liver histology of the two types. Thus HB was associated with more prominent parenchymal cell damage and Kupffer cell reaction, while intrahepatic cholestasis was found in a significantly higher frequency in cases presumed to represent HA. The presence of intrahepatic cholestasis was associated with higher levels of serum bilirubin but otherwise no correlation was found between liver morphology and biochemical liver tests. The patients included a group of young intravenous amphetamine addicts with HB. No differences of importance were found histologically in addicts and other patients with hepatitis B.
Increased brain weight-liver weight ratio as a necropsy sign of intrauterine undernutrition. Comparison of the brain weight/liver weight ratio(1) with the body weight of 95 stillborn and neonatally deceased infants of gestation 25-42 weeks shows that in appropriately grown infants the mean value ratio is 2.8 and is unchanged with increasing maturity. The normal range is 1.7-4.1. Survival time has no significant effect on the ratio as studied in this necropsy population. Dysmature infants of body weight less than 1 SD below the mean body weight for gestation are characterized by a brain: liver weight ratio of 4.5 or more. On the basis of these observations the brain: liver weight ratio may be employed as a guide to the prenatal nutrition of infants at necropsy.
Acute villous inflammation in the placenta following intrauterine transfusion. Infection is well recognized as a complication of intrauterine transfusion. The majority of cases are fortunately mild and consist merely of chorio-amnionitis. The present case, of severe type, resulted from contamination of the donor blood with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Spread of infection from foetus to mother has been carefully studied and an entirely new type of lesion in the placenta described. This takes the form of acute villous inflammation with resultant micro-abscess formation beneath the trophoblast layer and eventual rupture into the intervillous space. Attempts at localization are poor.
Some factors influencing the effect of cholesterol on streptolysin O activity. Inhibition of streptolysin O activity by cholesterol depends on the latter being in free form. The normal esterified and protein-bound cholesterol fractions in serum do not influence streptolysin O activity. However, high cholesterol levels in rabbits fed cholesterol with cholic acid were associated with an increased antistreptolysin O effect. It is suggested that this occurs when all available protein sites are saturated and where a true ;free' cholesterol fraction is present. Splitting the esterified cholesterol fraction of human sera with raised cholesterol levels, by means of pancreatin, produced an increased antistreptolysin O effect, again presumably because of saturation of protein-binding sites. Similarly, removal of non-esterified cholesterol from sera of cholesterolfed rabbits, by means of digitonin, reduced antistreptolysin O activity of the sera. Evidence is presented that combination of bovine serum albumin and streptolysin O has a steric hindrance effect on attachment of cholesterol to streptolysin O. The method described for the estimation of free cholesterol is extremely sensitive, being capable of detecting concentrations of less than 1.0 mug/ml.
The role of creatinine and histidine in Benedict's qualitative test for reducing sugar in urine. The statement made in some standard textbooks that Benedict's qualitative test gives a green, yellow, or orange-red precipitate with pure solutions of glucose of varying strength has been shown to be incorrect. Pure solutions of glucose give only a bright red precipitate at all concentrations. These changes in the colour of the suspensions are observed with urinary glucose only. The difference in the action of glucose in water and in urine has been shown to be mostly due to creatinine and to a small extent to the histidine content of urine. The colour of the precipitate depends not only on the concentration of glucose but also on that of creatinine. An increase in concentration of creatinine tends to make the precipitate more yellow. Histidine has a similar though much smaller effect. Attention has been drawn to possible errors in the semi-quantitative assay of urinary glucose by Benedict's test arising out of variation in concentration of creatinine and histidine.
Mode of action of creatinine on colour of cuprous oxide precipitate in Benedict's qualitative sugar test. Creatinine appears to alter the colour and bulky nature of the cuprous oxide precipitate not by altering the chemical composition of the precipitate but by the physical process of retardation of the growth of newly formed yellow cuprous oxide crystals to large red crystals by adhering to their surface and blocking some sites for further crystal growth.
A rapid micro-method for the screening and measurement of barbiturates and related compounds in plasma by gas-liquid chromatography. A rapid gas-chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of butobarbitone, amylobarbitone, hexabarbitone, pentobarbitone, quinalbarbitone, phenobarbitone glutethimide, and methaqualone in ;finger-prick' samples of plasma. This has been applied to the analysis of some of these drugs in plasma taken from patients after therapeutic dosage and over-dosage.

Cell-mediated immunity in patients positive for hepatitis-associated antigen. Cell-mediated immunity to antigens prepared from both serum and liver of patients positive for hepatitis-associated antigen (H.A.A.) was measured by using the leucocyte migration test. Altogether, 43 patients with H.A.A.-positive acute and chronic liver disease, eight with serum antibody to H.A.A., and 13 controls were studied. The cell-mediated immunity detected was specific for H.A.A. or other antigenic determinants of the associated infective agent and could be found only in patients with evidence of previous contact with H.A.A.Cell-mediated immunity to the H.A.A.-positive test antigens was found in all but one of the patients with acute hepatitis, in about half of the patients with chronic aggressive hepatitis or cirrhosis, rarely in those with chronic persistent hepatitis, and in none of the apparently healthy carriers.Our results support the hypothesis that the cellular immune response plays an important part in the clearance of the infective agent from H.A.A.-positive patients and in the pathogenesis of the associated liver cell injury.

THREE PATIENTS WITH LITHIUM TOXICITY ARE REPORTED, TWO OF WHOM WERE EXPOSED TO TOXIC LITHIUM LEVELS FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD: both survived with permanent damage to basal ganglia and cerebellar connexions despite effective lowering of lithium levels by haemodialysis. Data obtained during dialysis treatment show prolonged haemodialysis to be the treatment of choice. If facilities for haemodialysis are not available or the patient presents with toxic lithium levels and minimal symptoms peritoneal dialysis will effectively lower serum lithium levels, but more slowly than haemodialysis.
Dyslexia as cause of psychiatric disorder in adults. A few patients may be of normal intelligence but have difficulties in reading, writing, and spelling, which are the main precipitants of a psychiatric disorder. In seven patients this illiteracy emerged only after intensive examination, as they had hidden it from employers, friends, and children. Characteristically these patients are often very sensitive about this disability and marital friction is common. They are also often noticeably resistant to remedial help.

Alpha-fetoprotein in abortion. The clinical value of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a guide to the outcome of threatened abortion was assessed. After the thirteenth week of gestation, abortion occurred more frequently (10/12) in women with abnormal serum AFP levels than in those (2/12) whose AFP concentrations were within the normal range. Low levels were present in women with blighted ovum and high concentrations were associated with intrauterine fetal death. In legal first and second trimester abortions, the circulating maternal AFP levels in postabortion samples were often higher than before abortion, irrespective of whether abortion was performed instrumentally or induced with prostaglandins. Maternal serum AFP levels provide a new means for prediction of the outcome of threatened abortion.
Fatal paralytic ileus due to strongyloidiasis.
Controlled trial of treatment for cerebral concussion. In a study designed to compare two types of treatment of cerebral concussion, 178 patients were allocated to a routine treatment or to an active treatment group; in the latter a good prognosis was emphasized, the patient was mobilized early and given physiotherapy. In the routine treatment group the average time off work was 32 days compared with 18 days in the active treatment group. Physiotherapy seemed to be particularly valuable in old patients and in those with exaggerated fears about their condition. It is suggested that throughout their illness and follow-up, patients with cerebral concussion should be under the care of one doctor, one who is particularly interested in the subject and that more propaganda is needed

Working with the family doctor: a programme for mental health. A new type of assessment for mental health in four Scottish counties has been based on multidisciplinary teams comprising psychiatrists, psychiatric social worker, nursing administrator, and a secretary. Each team collaborated with 15 to 20 family doctors and they established four main patterns of contact: around an outpatient clinic; by informal availability; by administrative and teaching seminars; or by regular consultation sessions. This improved contact was found to help both the team and the family doctors and reduced the number of patients admitted to hospital and the length of their stay and the number of urgent referrals. It emphasizes the need for team work in mental health care and that the hospital needs to remain in touch with the outside community.

Composition of fluid obtained from choroid plexus tissue isolated in a chamber in situ. 1. A method was developed for isolating a segment of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle of the cat brain in a chamber in situ.2. A comparison of electrolyte and protein concentrations in serum, ultrafiltrate of serum, cisterna magna fluid, fluid accumulated in the chamber and fluid collected from the choroid plexus by another technique, demonstrates that the chamber fluid is a secretory product of the choroid plexus.3. The rate of fluid formation in the chamber was 0.4 mul. min(-1) mg(-1) of tissue, a value in good agreement with reports in the literature.4. The observation that the concentration of K(+) in choroid plexus fluid was lower than that in the serum ultrafiltrate suggests that K(+) is regulated by an active transport process at the choroid plexus.5. Significant correlation was found between electrolyte values and the protein content of the chamber fluid. This suggests that plasma is the probable source of the protein in the chamber fluid and that K(+) and probably Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) in c.s.f. are subject to active homoeostatic regulation by the choroid plexus.6. The technique described provides a new opportunity to study in detail the functional characteristics of the choroid plexus.
Analysis of responses in visual cells of the leech. 1. Potentials were recorded from the cytoplasm and from the vacuole of leech photoreceptors. Since the vacuole is lined with microvilli and is connected to the outside by narrow channels, the potential drops between vacuole and outside measure the current through the microvillar membrane.2. In darkness, the potential of the cytoplasm with respect to the outside is about - 45 mV while the potential of the vacuole is approximately zero.3. Following illumination the negativity of the cytoplasm decreases and the vacuole becomes negative relative to the outside.4. For dim intensities, the response to a flash of light may grow proportionately more than the intensity of the flash. This is probably due to development of a depolarizing local response.5. The resistance from the cytoplasm to the outside was about 150 MOmega in darkness and decreased to approximately 40 MOmega at the peak of the response to a bright flash (on average). Corresponding measurements from the vacuole gave 50 MOmega in darkness and 35 MOmega at the peak of the response.6. Charging curves produced by steps of constant currents applied to the cytoplasm or to the vacuole include two time constants (about 5 and 50 msec on average). The longer time constant decreases greatly with bright illumination.7. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the response to light is brought about by an increase of conductance of the microvillar membrane.
Transport of thyroxine glucuronide into bile. 1. The secretion of thyroxine glucuronide into bile has been investigated in the isolated perfused rat liver and also in the intact animal. Radioactive material for the study was prepared from the bile of rats treated with [(125)I]thyroxine.2. The isolated liver actively transports thyroxine glucuronide from the perfusion fluid (Tyrode solution) into the bile. At equilibrium, its concentration in the bile is about 1800 x its concentration in the perfusion fluid.3. Experiments with pulse infusions of glucuronide indicate that the substance enters the bile almost as soon as it is captured by the tissue.4. Secretion of thyroxine glucuronide is strongly inhibited by bromosulphophthalein, indicating a common carrier mechanism. It is suggested that secretion probably involves two stages - transfer from the perfusion fluid into the cell and then from the cell into the bile. The second stage is certainly active.5. When thyroxine glucuronide is injected intravenously into anaesthetized rats, some 77% is recovered from the bile, half of this being excreted within the first 14 min.
The geometrical factors determining the electrotonic properties of a molluscan neurone. 1. Light and electron micrographs of sections of the gastro-oesophageal giant neurone (G cell) of the nudibranch mollusc, Anisodoris nobilis, show that its somatic and axonal membranes are deeply infolded. The surface and volume of its soma and axon have been calculated from measurements taken at the light and electron microscope on sections of the G cell.2. The surface of the soma is approximately 7.5 times as large as that of a sphere having the same volume. For a typical cell the soma has a volume of 1.5 x 10(-5) cm(3) and a surface of 2 x 10(-2) cm(2); the axon has a volume of 5 x 10(-5) cm(3) and a surface of 5 x 10(-1) cm(2).3. Because the axon is star shaped in cross-section, its geometry cannot be described by a single parameter (diameter or radius). Furthermore, the axon is beaded, and both the area (A) and the perimeter (P) of its cross-section change from point to point.4. However, in spite of the apparent irregularity of their cross-sections, all axons examined could be characterized by a constant A/P ratio. This ratio also remains constant when the axons are stretched.5. According to the equations derived in the Appendix, the geometrical factor for the length constant in a folded fibre is H = radical(A/P); therefore, in the G cell the length constant (and hence the conduction velocity) should be independent of the stretch applied to the axon.6. The geometrical factor required to calculate the axonal input conductance is M = radical(A.P). M changes in adjacent segments of the same axon; in each segment its value depends on how much the axon is stretched.7. The input conductance of the whole axon can be calculated by applying a modified form of Rall's equations for dendritic trees. The results suggest that the input conductance of the G cell axon should vary with stretch and should be large in comparison to that of the soma.
Membrane potentials of epithelial cells in rat small intestine. 1. Stripped sacs of rat jejunum in which the outer muscle layers had been removed were found to maintain substantial transport and electrical activities.2. Mucosal and serosal membrane potentials of epithelial cells of normal and stripped everted sacs of rat jejunum were recorded in vitro together with the transmural potential difference.3. The cell interior was negative relative to both serosal and mucosal fluids, the transmural potential being the sum of the two membrane potentials.4. Changes in the transmural potentials in the presence of actively transferred hexoses and amino acids were entirely due to variations in the serosal potential, the mucosal potential being unchanged.5. Serosal and transmural potential increases on the addition of galactose were consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving apparent K(m) values of 14.9 and 14.1 mM respectively.6. Phlorrhizin, ouabain, 2,4-dinitrophenol and sodium fluoroacetate inhibited serosal potential changes in the presence of galactose.7. Osmotic potentials resulting from transmural osmotic gradients originated from the serosal layers of the tissue.8. The results are consistent with the concept of a serosally located, electrogenic sodium pump which is stimulated by actively transferred hexoses and amino acids. The sodium-dependent entry mechanism at the mucosal membrane is non-electrogenic.
Ionic basis of membrane potentials of epithelial cells in rat small intestine. 1. Potentials across the mucosal and serosal membranes of the epithelial cells of rat jejunum together with transmural potentials were recorded using everted sac preparations.2. Ionic changes in either mucosal or serosal fluids affect mucosal or serosal membrane potentials respectively with comparable changes in the transmural potential. The contralateral membrane potential is relatively unaffected.3. Replacement of mucosal sodium chloride by potassium chloride or lithium chloride had little effect on potentials, but its replacement by mannitol or Tris chloride increased the negativity of the mucosal potential, giving linear relationships against log(10)[Na](m) with slopes of 41.4 and 30.7 mV respectively for tenfold change in [Na](m).4. At constant [Na](m), potassium or lithium increased the mucosal potential by 25.7 and 19.8 mV respectively for tenfold concentration changes.5. Qualitatively similar changes occurred in the serosal potential when the ionic composition of the serosal fluid was varied.6. Mucosal potential changes in response to modifications of the ionic composition of the mucosal fluid were the same in the presence and absence of galactose.7. Sodium and potassium diffusion potentials largely determine both the mucosal and serosal membrane potentials. For the mucosal membrane, P(K):P(Na) is 1.26:1, and is probably higher for the serosal membrane. Chloride makes no significant contribution to membrane potentials.8. Potentials generated by the electrogenic sodium pump are superimposed on diffusion potentials across the serosal membrane.
The effect of distending the atrial appendages on urine flow in the dog. 1. Distension of the atrial appendages resulted in a diuresis, an increase in the rate of Na(+) excretion and an increase in heart rate.2. Both the urinary and heart rate responses to distension of the appendages were either abolished or much reduced by crushing the bases of the appendages.3. The diuresis in response to distension of the atrial appendages is similar to that previously described in response to distension of the pulmonary vein-atrial junctions by Ledsome & Linden (1968).4. It is concluded that stimulation of nerve endings within the atrial appendages results in a reflex increase in urine flow and heart rate.
The effects of stimulation of the left atrial receptors on sympathetic efferent nerve activity. 1. Activation of left atrial receptors by distension of balloons at the pulmonary vein-atrial junctions caused an increase in the cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, a decrease in the renal sympathetic nerve activity, and no change in the lumbar and splenic sympathetic nerve activity.2. The cardiac and renal nerve responses to balloon distension were abolished by vagal blockade in the neck.3. The results provide additional evidence that the reflex increase in the heart rate following stimulation of the left atrial receptors is mediated by selective activation of cardiac sympathetic nerve fibres.4. The inhibitory effect of atrial receptor activation on the renal sympathetic nerve activity suggests that a neural factor, possibly involving renal haemodynamics, may be a component of the diuretic response to the activation of the left atrial receptors.5. The results provide further evidence for the selective nature of the pattern of reflex responses to left atrial receptor activation and show for the first time a directionally fractionated response from sympathetic efferent neurones.
S-potentials in the dark-adapted retina of the carp. 1. S-potentials were recorded in the dark-adapted carp retina. After recording, Procion Yellow was injected from the recording electrode to identify histologically the cell recorded.2. Both L- and C-type S-potentials were found. L-type S-potentials were further classified into two groups. The first group was characterized by a high threshold, fast rise and fall times and a spectral sensitivity peak of about 620 nm. The second group showed a low threshold, slow response time course and a spectral sensitivity peak of about 520 nm.3. Cells of the first group were identified as external and internal horizontal cells. Cells of the second group were identified as intermediate horizontal cells.4. In the dark-adapted retina, the spectral sensitivity of the intermediate horizontal cell showed a good agreement with the absorption spectrum of the rod pigment, porphyropsin.5. Neither a chromatic background nor white background illumination of moderate intensity (1 cd.m(-2)) shifted the spectral sensitivity of the intermediate horizontal cell.6. Under a strong background (10 cd.m(-2)), the intermediate horizontal cell was entirely suppressed. Under the same conditions the external horizontal cell was still capable of responding.7. From these observations it is concluded that the intermediate horizontal cell receives input from rods only.
Physiological correlates of adaptation to a rotated visual field. 1. Perceptual adaptation to a 30 or 45 degrees visual tilt was induced in human subjects by means of prismatic spectacles worn for 5-7 days. Relative contrast thresholds and the amplitudes of the occipital potentials to vertical and oblique gratings were studied.2. During continuous exposure to the tilted visual environment the normal differences between contrast thresholds for vertical and oblique targets decreased or were no longer significant. In all subjects the change from control threshold differences was significant at the 0.005 level.3. During the course of adaptation the difference in amplitude of the potentials evoked by vertical and oblique oscillating gratings also decreased. The changes with respect to control differences were significant at the 0.005 level in each subject.4. Intermittent exposure to tilt in one subject resulted only in minor adaptation of the apparent vertical, and the evoked potential differences did not change from control levels.5. The changes are interpreted as suggesting that plastic changes in the extraretinal mechanism responsive to target orientation occur during adaptation to prismatic tilt.
The passive electrical properties of the membrane of a molluscan neurone. 1. The passive electrical properties of the membrane of the gastrooesophageal giant neurone (G cell) of the marine mollusc, Anisodoris nobilis were studied with small current steps.2. The membrane transient response can be fitted with a theoretical curve assuming as a model for the cell a sphere (soma) connected to a cable (axon). The axo-somatic conductance ratio (rho), determined by applying this model, is large (approximately 5) and the membrane time constant (tau) is long (approximately 1 sec).3. When the actual surface area of the cell, corrected for surface infoldings, and the spread of current along its axon is taken into account, the electrical measurements imply a specific resistance of the membrane of approximately 1.0 MOmega.cm(2).4. Estimates of specific membrane capacity, either from measurements of the initial portion of the membrane transient or from the ratio of the time constant to the specific membrane resistance are close to the value of 1 muF/cm(2) expected for biological membranes.5. Thus, our measurements of specific capacitance, time constant, length constant and axo-somatic conductance ratio all indicate that the value found for the specific membrane resistance of the G cell, while unexpectedly large, is valid.6. The magnitude of this value suggests that the conductance (permeability) of its membrane to ions is much smaller than that previously assumed for nerve membranes; this small conductance may be related to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the G cell.
Habituation and acclimatization of sheep to cold following exposures of varying length and severity. 1. Male and female Scottish Blackface sheep were shorn and exposed for 2 weeks either to a thermoneutral temperature (+30 degrees C), to chronic cold (+8 degrees C) or to +30 degrees C interrupted by daily short cold shocks (-10 degrees C). During and at the end of these conditioning treatments, the sheep also received two acute cold exposures (-20 degrees C, 4 m.p.h. wind for 2-8 hr) 1 week apart. Some of these sheep and a fourth (control) group, were subsequently re-shorn and slowly cooled to +8 degrees C.2. Resting metabolism and the metabolic response to cooling (both inferred from heart rates) were increased by previous chronic cold treatment. Resistance to body cooling (measured during acute cold exposure) was generally increased by both chronic and acute cold, and non-shivering thermogenesis was probably induced in the female sheep. These effects were defined as acclimatization.3. In contrast, cold shocks reduced the subsequent metabolic response to cold and encouraged facultative body cooling. This pattern of response (defined as habituation) therefore caused greater thermolability.4. Habituation and acclimatization were antagonistic. Habituation was removed by acute cold exposure and, conversely, acclimatization was inhibited by short cold shocks.5. There were sex differences in response but these were confounded by probable differences in insulation and in body condition (males thinner).6. It was concluded that the induction of different forms of adaptation depended on the length, severity and frequency of cold exposures. Habituation to whole body cold exposure apparently involved central nervous system centres normally receiving peripheral cold stimuli.
The control of the plasma choline concentration in the cat. 1. Changes in choline concentration of the blood after injections or infusions of choline were studied in cats anaesthetized with chloralose.2. Single I.V. injections of choline 10-100 mumole/kg produced arterial plasma levels 1 min later corresponding to an apparent volume of initial distribution of 430 ml./kg. The concentration then declined rapidly (half-time, 1-2 min), with a later slower decline after large doses.3. Infusions of choline at a rate of 0.8 mumole/kg.min or greater produced steady rises in plasma level, corresponding to a clearance of 28.6 ml. plasma/kg.min. The half time of rate of approach to steady state was 7 min or less. Infusions at rates of 0.40 mumole/kg.min or less produced much smaller or negligible rises, suggesting mechanisms for disposal which were saturated at higher concentration. At low rates, little infused choline appeared in urine. At the end of an infusion, the plasma choline level usually fell without delay.4. Portal blood contained about 50% of the arterial level, renal venous blood 15-70%, caval blood 30-60%, and amniotic fluid 2.5%. Occlusion of renal coeliac or mesenteric arteries raised plasma choline, but relatively rapid choline removal still occurred in the eviscerate animal.5. After infusions of [methyl-(14)C]choline, the level of radioactivity retained in the circulation amounted to only a few per cent of the total dose infused. At low rates of infusion (0.0125-0.1 mumole/kg.min) the radioactivity represented only a small fraction of bio-assayable choline; but at 0.40 mumole/kg.min it came to exceed the concentration of free choline, indicating metabolic conversion. Only traces of (14)C were found in expired air, and only 1-1.5% of total infused radioactivity in the urine. After infusion of 150 mumole over 3 hr, high levels of radioactivity were found in liver, kidney, lung, brain and heart, but levels in muscle and spleen were comparable to that of blood.6. It was concluded that choline is rapidly lost from the blood, that the abdominal viscera, liver, kidney and lung are important extraction sites, that some partial metabolism occurs, the metabolites also being rapidly lost from blood, and that it is probable that choline lost to the tissues becomes bound in some form.
Demonstration of choline acetyltransferase activity in the caotid body of the cat. 1. The distribution of choline acetyltransferase in the carotid body of the cat has been investigated with the electron microscope to determine sites of enzymic activity. This is of relevance to the possible role of acetylcholine as a transmitter in the carotid body.2. Tissues were fixed for short periods and incubated by the method of Kasa, Mann & Hebb, for the fine structural localization of choline acetyltransferase.3. The enzyme was found in the cytoplasm of the type I cells and seemed to be associated with vesicles. No enzyme was found in the large nerve endings synapsing with the type I cell.4. Whole carotid bodies were assayed for their choline acetyltransferase activity and significant amounts were found.5. It is concluded that acetylcholine may be a transmitter in the carotid body and that it is synthesized in type I cells. A possible mode of initiation of chemoreceptor afferent impulses is suggested.
The binding of labelled tetrodotoxin to non-myelinated nerve fibres. 1. Tritiated tetrodotoxin has been prepared and purified, and its binding to rabbit, lobster, and garfish non-myelinated nerve fibres examined.2. In each case a component of the binding curve was found that saturated at concentrations of a few nanomolar.3. In addition, non-specific binding, indicated by a linear dependence of the amount bound on concentration, occurred.4. The kinetics of wash-in and wash-out of the radioactive toxin were consistent with a model in which all binding was rapid and reversible and in which diffusion into and out of the nerve bundle was rate-limiting. This was shown by numerical solution of the appropriate non-linear diffusion equation. An extension of the limited biophase model that allows for non-specific binding was shown to give good semiquantitative approximations to the proper diffusion equation; and (unlike the latter) the extension was shown to have a relatively simple solution.5. A number of pharmacological agents were tested for competition with, or perturbation of, tetrodotoxin binding: sodium, calcium and hydrogen ions, lidocaine, batrachotoxin and saxitoxin. Apart from a small calcium effect, only saxitoxin, whose effect on sodium current is similar to that of tetrodotoxin, was found to interfere with binding. Increasing saxitoxin concentrations resulted in reduced amounts of tetrodotoxin binding in a manner consistent with a competition between the two toxins for the same site.

Metabolism of ( 14 C)methamphetamine in man, the guinea pig and the rat. 1. The metabolites of (+/-)-2-methylamino-1-phenyl[1-(14)C]propane ([(14)C]methamphetamine) in urine were examined in man, rat and guinea pig. 2. In two male human subjects receiving the drug orally (20mg per person) about 90% of the (14)C was excreted in the urine in 4 days. The urine of the first day was examined for metabolites, and the main metabolites were the unchanged drug (22% of the dose) and 4-hydroxymethamphetamine (15%). Minor metabolites were hippuric acid, norephedrine, 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine and an acid-labile precursor of benzyl methyl ketone. 3. In the rat some 82% of the dose of (14)C (45mg/kg) was excreted in the urine and 2-3% in the faeces in 3-4 days. In 2 days the main metabolites in the urine were 4-hydroxymethamphetamine (31% of dose), 4-hydroxynorephedrine (16%) and unchanged drug (11%). Minor metabolites were amphetamine, 4-hydroxyamphetamine and benzoic acid. 4. The guinea pig was injected intraperitoneally with the drug at two doses, 10 and 45mg/kg. In both cases nearly 90% of the (14)C was excreted, mainly in the urine after the lower dose, but in the urine (69%) and faeces (18%) after the higher dose. The main metabolites in the guinea pig were benzoic acid and its conjugates. Minor metabolites were unchanged drug, amphetamine, norephedrine, an acid-labile precursor of benzyl methyl ketone and an unknown weakly acidic metabolite. The output of norephedrine was dose-dependent, being about 19% on the higher dose and about 1% on the lower dose. 5. Marked species differences in the metabolism of methamphetamine were observed. The main reaction in the rat was aromatic hydroxylation, in the guinea pig demethylation and deamination, whereas in man much of the drug, possibly one-half, was excreted unchanged.
Lysosomal localization of  -fructofuranosidase-containing liposomes injected into rats. Yeast beta-fructofuranosidase (invertase) or (131)I-labelled albumin were entrapped into liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and phosphatidic acid. Of the beta-fructofuranosidase activity in the liposomal preparations 96-100% was latent. The following observations were made in experiments with rats injected with protein-containing liposomes. 1. After injection of beta-fructofuranosidase-containing liposomes (220 units or 1.5mg of beta-fructofuranosidase and 17.5mg of lipid), beta-fructofuranosidase activity in blood retained its latency but the activity declined to 50% of the injected dose in 1h. Within 6h much of this activity was recovered in the liver and spleen (respectively 45% and 10% of that injected). For up to 21h after injection, the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction was the principal location of the hepatic beta-fructofuranosidase activity. 2. Lysosomal localization of liposomal protein was supported by the observed increase in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity during incubation of the lysosome-rich fraction of the liver of rats injected with liposomes containing (131)I-labelled albumin. 3. Association of liposomal protein with lysosomes was demonstrated on subfractionation of the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction of the liver of rats injected with beta-fructofuranosidase-containing liposomes in a Ficoll-mannitol gradient. beta-Fructofuranosidase, lysosomal and mitochondrial enzyme marker activities were found to exhibit similar distribution patterns along the gradient. However, in similar experiments with rats previously injected with Triton WR-1339 or dextran (known to alter the specific gravity of lysosomes), only beta-fructofuranosidase and lysosomal marker moved along the gradient, in strikingly similar patterns. 4. The lysosomal localization of injected liposome-entrapped material can probably be utilized in the treatment of certain disorders in man.
Alcoholysis of the endogenous phosphate esters in rats treated with large doses of ethanol. 1. Monoethyl phosphate was isolated from the liver of rats treated with large doses of ethanol. The (14)C- and (32)P-labelled products were obtained when [2-(14)C]ethanol and [(32)P]orthophosphate respectively were used as the radioactive precursors. 2. The isolated ethyl phosphate preparations were identified by their chemical properties, chromatographic behaviour and enzymic hydrolysis, which, for the (14)C-labelled substrate, resulted in a partial recovery of the administered [(14)C]ethanol. 3. The possibility of artifact formation of ethyl phosphate was excluded by suitable control experiments. 4. It is concluded that ethyl phosphate formed in vivo may be a product of phosphate-catalysed alcoholysis of various phosphate esters. The physiological significance of the possible substitution of water by ethanol in reactions catalysed by hydrolytic enzymes under conditions of acute body intoxication with the alcohol is emphasized.
The metabolism of  14 C-labelled  -methyldopa in normal and hypertensive human subjects. 1. The fate of orally administered (14)C-labelled l-alpha-methyldopa has been examined in three normal men and in eight hypertensive patients who responded to the drug and three who did not. 2. The output of (14)C in the urine in 2 days and in the faeces in 4 days was not very different in any of the subjects. The normals excreted about 40% of the dose in the urine and 60% in the faeces, the responders 52% (range 35-60%) and 45% and the non-responders 42% and 41%. Most of the urinary (14)C radioactivity was eliminated in 24h after dosing. 3. The main metabolite in the urine was free and conjugated alpha-methyldopa (normal men, 23%; responders, 37%; non-responders, 25% of the dose). Free and conjugated 3-O-methyl-alpha-methyldopa was about 4% in all subjects, total amines (alpha-methyldopamine and 3-O-methyl-alpha-methyldopamine) about 6% and ketones (mainly 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetone) about 3%. 4. The output of alpha-methyldopamine (2-4% of dose), 3-O-methyl-alpha-methyldopamine (0.3%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetone (3-5%) was similar in the one normal and two responders examined. 5. The faecal (14)C in all subjects was unchanged l-alpha-methyldopa. 6. In general, the amounts of the metabolites in the urine in normal men and in responding and non-responding patients were quantitatively similar, except in one non-responding patient who converted nearly two-thirds of the absorbed drug into amines and ketones. There appeared to be no correlation between metabolites in the urine and response or lack of response to the drug. 7. In two normal subjects 70-80% of d-alpha-methyldopa was excreted unchanged in the faeces. Of the absorbed compound most (9-14% of the dose) was excreted as the free and conjugated drug together with a small amount (1-2%) of 3-O-methyl-alpha-methyldopa. No amines and only traces of ketone were excreted.
A reaction of glucose with peptides. Valylhistidine (Val-His) reacts with glucose (Glc) in a mixture of pyridine and acetic acid to form glucosylvalylhistidine (Glc-Val-His). The pK of the alpha-amino group is thereby lowered to about 5.6 as judged by electrophoretic mobility. The reaction: [Formula: see text] also occurs in an aqueous solution of pyridine and acetic acid of pH6.2 at 50 degrees C, in which it exhibits a half-time of about 30h and a dissociation constant of about 0.3m. Isoleucyltyrosine and glucose react similarly in aqueous solution. The Glc-Val-His has the chromatographic, electrophoretic and chemical properties reported by Holmquist & Schroeder (1966a) for the substance released by proteolysis from the N-terminus of the beta-chains of haemoglobin A(Ic); the value of the dissociation constant means that the concentration of haemoglobin A(Ic) found naturally could be explained by reaction of haemoglobin A with the blood glucose.

Norephedrines as metabolites of ( 14 C)amphetamine in urine in man. (+/-)-[(14)C]Amphetamine sulphate (20mg) was administered orally to each of two human male subjects, and 80-85% of the (14)C was excreted in the urine in 2 days. The metabolites in the first day's urine were examined quantitatively. Apart from the metabolites previously described (Dring et al., 1970), norephedrine (2.2 and 2.6% of dose in the two subjects respectively) and 4-hydroxynorephedrine (0.3 and 0.4% of dose in the two subjects respectively) were also found.
Biliary excretion of amphetamine and methamphetamine in the rat. 1. (14)C-labelled amphetamine and methamphetamine were injected into rats cannulated at the bile duct under thiopentone anaesthesia and the output of their metabolites in urine and bile was determined. 2. With amphetamine, 69% of the (14)C was excreted in the urine and 16% in the bile in 24h. The main metabolite in bile was the glucuronide of 4-hydroxyamphetamine. The output of unchanged amphetamine was much greater in cannulated rats than in intact rats. 3. With methamphetamine, 54% of the (14)C appeared in the urine and 18% in the bile. The main metabolite in the bile was the glucuronide of 4-hydroxynorephedrine. The output of amphetamine, a metabolite of methamphetamine, was much greater in cannulated rats than in intact rats. 4. Evidence has been obtained for the enterohepatic circulation of certain amphetamine and methamphetamine metabolites in the rat. 5. Thiopentone anaesthesia appeared to inhibit the ring hydroxylation of amphetamine administered as such or formed as a metabolite of methamphetamine.
Specific inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by 2-bromopalmitate and its coenzyme A and carnitine esters. 1. The CoA and carnitine esters of 2-bromopalmitate are extremely powerful and specific inhibitors of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. 2. 2-Bromopalmitoyl-CoA, added as such or formed from 2-bromopalmitate, inhibits the carnitine-dependent oxidation of palmitate or palmitoyl-CoA, but not the oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine, by intact liver mitochondria. 3. 2-Bromopalmitoylcarnitine inhibits the oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine as well as that of palmitate or palmitoyl-CoA. It has no effect on succinate oxidation, but inhibits that of pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate or hexanoate; however, the oxidation of these substrates (but not of palmitate, palmitoyl-CoA or palmitoyl-carnitine) is restored by carnitine. 4. In damaged mitochondria, added 2-bromopalmitoyl-CoA does inhibit palmitoylcarnitine oxidation; pyruvate oxidation is unaffected by the inhibitor alone, but is impaired if palmitoylcarnitine is subsequently added. 5. The findings have been interpreted as follows. 2-Bromopalmitoyl-CoA inactivates (in a carnitine-dependent manner) a pool of carnitine palmitoyltransferase which is accessible to external acyl-CoA. This results in inhibition of palmitate or palmitoyl-CoA oxidation. A second pool of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, inaccessible to added acyl-CoA in intact mitochondria, can generate bromopalmitoyl-CoA within the matrix from external 2-bromopalmitoylcarnitine; this reaction is reversible. Such internal 2-bromopalmitoyl-CoA inactivates long-chain beta-oxidation (as does added 2-bromopalmitoyl-CoA if the mitochondria are damaged) and its formation also sequesters intramitochondrial CoA. Since this CoA is shared by pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases, the oxidation of their substrates is depressed by 2-bromopalmitoylcarnitine, unless free carnitine is available to act as a ;sink' for long-chain acyl groups. 6. These effects are compared with those reported for other inhibitors of fatty acid oxidation.
Inhibition of the thrombin-fibrinogen reaction by a macromolecular factor from rat liver. 1. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation of a rat liver homogenate at 100000g for 1h contained a heat-labile macromolecular inhibitor of the thrombin-fibrinogen reaction. 2. The inhibitor was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by repeated preparative polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. Inhibition was observed with purified inhibitor equivalent to about 1mug of protein/ml. 3. The inhibitor had a pI of 3.50-3.75, a molecular weight (from sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis) of 72000+/-3000 and was inactivated by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate or 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). 4. Kinetic studies revealed a non-competitive inhibition, with the inhibitor probably acting on the thrombin-fibrinogen complex.
Conformational changes in human lens proteins in cataract. The reactivity of protein thiol groups in human lens and the susceptibility of the proteins to tryptic digestion were investigated. Both were found to be greater in some cataractous lenses, indicating that lens proteins have unfolded during cataractogenesis. Almost all the tyrosine in the proteins of the normal human lens reacts with tetranitromethane and is therefore probably on the outside of the major lens proteins.

Nutritional value of midday meals of senior schoolchildren. A survey of 565 senior schoolchildren showed that 41% took the school meal. It provided 27% of the daily recommended energy intake and 35% of the daily protein intake set by the Department of Health and Social Security. Of the children who did not take the school meal 4% had a meal which compared favourably with it, though an equal number ate no lunch at all. The remainder either brought snacks from home or bought foods which were found to be both low in protein, iron, and calcium, and high in sugar. Sweets and chips provided the main source of energy for 9% of the subjects.
Prevalence of antibody to current influenza viruses and effect of vaccination on antibody response. The extent of antibody to the influenza virus A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) after four years of prevalence was investigated in Britain and in the U.S.A. The results indicated a high incidence in both populations. The prevalence of antibody to a variant A/England/42/72 (H3N2) which has been causing epidemics of influenza in the southern hemisphere during the middle months of 1972 was also investigated. The differences reflect the shift in antigenic content of this variant, and although the overall proportion of the sera with antibody at > 1/40 was 37%, some age groups had an incidence of only 20% or less with antibody at this level. A commercial inactivated A/Hong Kong/68 influenza vaccine was given to a group of volunteers in Britain to see how effective it might be in stimulating antibody to the variant A/England/42/72. The antibody responses were better than expected from earlier vaccine studies, and 63% of the vaccinees developed antibody to the A/England/42/72 to levels thought likely to be protective. This suggested that until a vaccine made with the variant A/England/42/72 becomes available the present A/Hong Kong/68 vaccine would be of use to protect those at special risk this winter.
Method of breech management incoporating use of fetal blood sampling. We have developed a method of breech management based on the use of fetal blood sampling. Twenty-five cases were studied throughout labour, and fetal blood samples taken throughout the first and second stages. These showed that the Apgar score at one minute correlated closely with the fetal pH just before delivery. We believe that cord compression is an important variable factor which can be assessed only by fetal blood sampling. If this shows that fetal anoxia is becoming severe then immediate delivery is mandatory.
cutaneous sarcoidosis in blood donation venepuncture sites. Six patients were studied in whom sarcoidosis first showed itself by the development of granulomata at the site of previous venepunctures.

Concept of a paediatric emergency ward for the cities of a developing country. Children's hospitals in developing countries carry an enormous patient load. Available facilities must be organized to provide essential care for all. At the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town this has been achieved by the development of an emergency ward attached to the outpatient department. It is suggested that this concept should be applied in large hospitals of other developing countries.

Internodal conduction in undissected demyelinated nerve fibres. 1. A new method is described for recording external longitudinal currents from single undissected nerve fibres in rat ventral roots. The method permits identification of the sites of fifteen or more successive nodes of Ranvier in a given single fibre and the measurement of internodal conduction times between them.2. Average internodal conduction time for normal ventral root fibres of internodal length between 0.75 and 1.45 mm is 19.7 +/- 4.6 (S.D.) musec at 37 degrees C. Internodal conduction time appeared to show a minimum for fibres of internodal length 1.0 mm.3. Ventral roots were demyelinated by focal application of diphtheria toxin. Although conduction is markedly slowed in demyelinated fibres, sites of inward membrane current remain spatially separated indicating that conduction remains saltatory to the point of conduction block rather than becoming continuous as in unmyelinated fibres.4. Slowing of conduction appears to be due to changes in the passive electrical properties of the internodal myelin. Evidence is presented suggesting that there is an increase in internodal capacitance and a decrease in internodal transverse resistance at internodes of demyelinated fibres; such changes would have the effect of delaying excitation at the nodes. The changes in passive electrical properties, which appear to be primarily in the vicinity of the nodes, would be consistent with the pathological changes observed in demyelinated fibres.5. Internodal conduction times in demyelinated fibres have ranged from normal (26 musec at 30 degrees C) to more than 600 musec. There is a great variation in internodal conduction time at successive internodes of a given single fibre; this presumably reflects the varying severity of demyelination of successive internodes.6. As in normal fibres, nodes of demyelinated fibres generate less current when excited by the second of two closely spaced impulses. This results in an increased internodal conduction time for the second impulse and, at a critically short interstimulus interval, conduction block of the second impulse.7. The increased refractory period of transmission of internodes with increased internodal conduction times is a consequence of the decreased ability of such internodes to sustain propagation in the face of small decreases in nodal current.8. During tetanic stimulation, increases in internodal conduction time are associated with corresponding decreases in nodal current generated by the node proximal to the internode in question.9. It is suggested that changes in the magnitude of the nodal current during repetitive activity are due to changes in transmembrane concentration gradients of sodium, the increased internodal conduction time and eventual conduction block during tetanic stimulation being caused by intracellular sodium accumulation.10. Intracellular sodium accumulation is also offered as the explanation for the post-tetanic depression seen in demyelinated fibres.
Effects of some cardiac glycosides on the post-hypoxic enzyme release from isolated rat hearts.
Hypomagnesaemia following theophylline or furosemide injection in ewes: renal versus extrarenal effect. 1. Intravenous theophylline infusion (30 mg/kg body weight during 90 min) induces in normal ewes a magnesuria associated with hypomagnesaemia. Intravenous furosemide infusion (1 mg/kg body weight during 90 min) induces in the same animals a similar magnesuria with only a slight hypomagnesaemia.2. In magnesium deficient ewes, theophylline induces a hypomagnesaemia, without a significant rise in magnesuria.3. Theophylline infusion, with simultaneous reinjection of the excess magnesium excreted in urine, induces a significant hypomagnesaemia.4. Thyroidectomy does not inhibit the effect of theophylline on magnesaemia.5. It is concluded that the effect of theophylline on magnesaemia is mainly of extrarenal origin, while the effect of furosemide is only renal. The effect of theophylline is not mediated through calcitonin secretion.

Vasopressin clearance and secretion during haemorrhage in normal dogs and in dogs with experimental diabetes insipidus. 1. The secretion of vasopressin in response to haemorrhagic shock has been investigated in anaesthetized dogs.2. The changes in the plasma concentrations of vasopressin were followed over a period of 5 hr, during which the arterial blood pressure was kept constant at 40 mm Hg. It was found that vasopressin concentration in plasma rose to a high peak shortly after the onset of shock and gradually declined thereafter. Five hours later, it was still 3.5 times higher than control. Re-transfusion of blood was followed by a return to control levels.3. The clearance of vasopressin was calculated before and during shock in normal dogs and in dogs with experimental diabetes insipidus. Soon after the onset of shock, the clearance rate dropped to one quarter of its normal level but slowly recovered, returning to near control values at the fifth hour of shock. Clearance rates did not vary as a function of infusion rates, suggesting that there is no maximal transport rate for the removal of the hormone over the entire secretory range found in normal and hypotensive dogs.4. From the clearance rates and from the plasma concentrations of endogenously secreted vasopressin it has been possible to calculate the approximate secretory rates of the hormone in response to shock. Secretion rose to a very high level, some 40 times greater than control, at the onset of shock. This was followed by a fairly constant secretory plateau. At the fifth hour of shock secretion was 3.5 times higher than control.5. The half-life of vasopressin was measured in normal and hypotensive dogs. Control measurements confirm the generally accepted value of approximately 5 min. The half-life was significantly higher in the early stage of shock, but returned to control values in the later stage.6. Haemorrhage experiments performed in normal and diabetic dogs suggest that vasopressin may play a part in the development of irreversible haemorrhagic shock: all normal animals died within a few hours of retransfusion, whereas four out of eight diabetic dogs similarly treated survived a 24 hr observation period. In a separate set of experiments, eight diabetic dogs were subjected to the haemorrhage procedure while receiving a constant infusion of vasopressin: only two of these survived. Surviving dogs showed none of the characteristic lesions of irreversible haemorrhagic shock.

Kinetic properties of the sodium current in striated muscle fibres on the basis of the Hodgkin-Huxley theory. 1. The kinetic properties of the sodium current in skeletal muscle fibre, obtained from records in a double sucrose-gap apparatus, have been analysed in terms of the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation by means of a curve fitting computer program.2. The net sodium currents were obtained by subtracting records in Ringer and Ringer tetrodotoxin; the currents are inward for depolarizations V from +25 to +128 mV (V(Na)). The I(Na)-V characteristic shows a small inward rectification for V > + 128 mV.3. The characteristics of both sodium conductance and permeability are described.4. The activation and inactivation parameters, m and h, are calculated and compared with those experimentally established in a previous work (Ildefonse & Rougier, 1972) and with the results of Adrian, Chandler & Hodgkin (1970).5. The currents calculated with these parameter values fit rather well with the experimental ones, the permeability approach being slightly better.6. The main difference between the experimental and calculated curves is the slower inactivation of the calculated current at V = +55 mV; this difference is envisaged as a possible consequence of some activity in the tubular system of the muscle fibre.

Carbamino compounds of haemoglobin in human adult and foetal blood. 1. The carbamate (HbCO(2)) concentration in oxygenated and deoxygenated human adult and foetal red blood cells was estimated at a constant pressure of carbon dioxide (P(CO2) = 40 mm Hg) and various pH values of the serum. The Donnan ratio for chloride and bicarbonate ions was used to calculate the bicarbonate concentration in the red cells. With this figure the carbamate concentration was calculated as follows:[HbCO(2)] = [Total CO(2)] - [HCO(-) (3)] - [dissolved CO(2)].2. At a given pH value in the red cell deoxygenated foetal red cells contain more HbCO(2) than deoxygenated adult ones. Upon oxygenation (at constant pH) HbCO(2) drops in both types of erythrocytes to lower values than in deoxygenated cells. The fraction of ;oxylabile carbamate' (-DeltaHbCO(2)/DeltaHbO(2)) at a red cell pH of 7.2 and a P(CO2) of 40 mm Hg is 0.117 in foetal and 0.081 in adult erythrocytes.3. From the fraction of moles carbamate formed per Hb monomer (moles CO(2)/mole Hb(i)) K'(c) and K'(z), the apparent carbamate equilibrium constants were calculated which can be used to estimate the carbamate concentration in normal adult and foetal blood.4. The first apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid is significantly higher in oxygenated (-log(10)K'(1) = pK'(1) = 6.10) than in deoxygenated (pK'(1) = 6.12) adult red cells, whereas in foetal red cells the difference is smaller and statistically not significant.5. For a given set of physiological conditions in arterial and mixed venous blood in respect to oxygen saturation, P(CO2) and pH, the fractional contribution of carbamino compounds of haemoglobin to the amount of carbon dioxide which is exchanged during the respiratory cycle was computed on the basis of the present results and found to be 10.5% in adult and 19% in foetal blood.
Intrahepatic distribution of portal and hepatic arterial blood flows in anaesthetized cats and dogs and the effects of portal occlusion, raised venous pressure and histamine. 1. Radioactive microspheres were used to determine the distribution of arterial and portal flows within the liver. (141)Ce-microspheres and (51)Cr-spheres were given to allow two determinations of flow distribution in each animal and experiments are described to establish the accuracy and validity of the method.2. Mean flow/g to any lobe or segment of a lobe in a group of animals was not markedly different from the mean flow/g to the whole liver, and in general the liver was homogeneously perfused with both portal and arterial blood. However, in any one liver, some areas received a relatively greater flow (up to 300%) and some a relatively smaller flow (down to 50%) at the time the microspheres were given. The gall bladder received a much smaller portal flow/g than the parenchyma but its arterial flow/g varied widely in different animals.3. If portal flow to an area of parenchyma was reduced by occlusion of a branch of the portal vein, this area received a significantly increased arterial flow.4. An increase in hepatic venous pressure did not cause a significant change in the intrahepatic distribution of either arterial or portal flows in cats.5. In dogs, infusions of histamine into the portal vein caused a redistribution of portal flow away from the free ends of the lobes towards the hilar ends but the distribution between lobes did not change and there was no redistribution of arterial flow.

Comparison of the effects of hepatic nerve stimulation on arterial flow, distribution of arterial and portal flows and blood content in the livers of anaesthetized cats and dogs. 1. The responses to hepatic nerve stimulation were studied in cats and dogs anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. In three series of experiments, hepatic arterial flow was recorded by an electromagnetic flowmeter, intrahepatic distributions of arterial and portal flows were studied by radioactive microspheres, and hepatic volume responses were measured by a plethysmographic method.2. In cats, nerve stimulation produced a frequency-dependent decrease in hepatic arterial flow which was not maintained and autoregulatory escape occurred. In dogs, the initial decrease in arterial flow was similar but escape did not occur and the vasoconstriction was well maintained.3. In both cats and dogs, stimulation of the hepatic nerves did not cause a redistribution of either arterial or portal flows within the liver. Autoregulatory escape in the liver of the cat was not associated with an intrahepatic redistribution of arterial flow and is best interpreted as relaxation of the same vessels which were initially constricted, due to increased production of a vasodilator factor.4. Stimulation of the hepatic nerves caused a marked frequency-dependent decrease in hepatic volume which was well maintained and the responses were similar in cats and dogs. The quantitative importance of the liver as a blood reservoir is compared in relation to other vascular beds and the concept of the blood volume reserve is discussed.

Daily changes in foetal urine and relationships with amniotic and allantoic fluid and maternal plasma during the last two months of pregnancy in conscious, unstressed ewes with chronically implanted catheters. 1. The fluid sacs and bladders of ten foetuses and the allantoic sacs of five foetuses were catheterized between 79 and 96 days gestational age and daily samples were withdrawn until lambs were born naturally at approximately 147 days. Maternal jugular plasma obtained daily allowed the nutritional status of each ewe to be regulated and monitored. All lambs were observed for 7 weeks, and at post-mortem no abnormalities were seen in those operated upon in utero.2. The osmolality, [Na(+)], [K(+)], [Cl(-)], [glucose], [fructose], [urea], [amino acid] and pH of all samples were measured.3. Foetal surgery seemed to affect the actual concentrations of some solutes, but gestational trends in foetal fluid composition were unaltered.4. Until about 7 days before birth the foetal urine osmolality, [Na(+)], [Cl(-)] and [fructose] decreased, its [urea], [amino acid] and pH remained relatively constant, and from about 120 days gestational age the [K(+)] increased. During the last 7 days there was a marked increase in the osmolality and the concentrations of all these solutes, and a decrease in pH.5. Entry of foetal urine into the fluid sacs tended to decrease the osmolality, [Na(+)], [K(+)], [Cl(-)] and [glucose] of both foetal fluids and the [amino acid] of allantoic fluid, and tended to increase the [fructose] and [urea] of both fluids and the [amino acid] of amniotic fluid.6. Changes in urine composition suggested large daily variations in the secretion of foetal antidiuretic hormone and also a rapid increase in its secretion during the last 7 days, and particularly the last 2-4 days before birth.7. Changes in the [Na(+)]/[K(+)] ratios of foetal urine and allantoic fluid were parallel during post-operative recovery, during the course of pregnancy and immediately before birth, and this was consistent with a simultaneous action of foetal plasma corticosteroids on the foetal kidneys and chorioallantois.8. Variations in the [fructose] of foetal urine and allantoic fluid were parallel to changes in their [Na(+)]/[K(+)] ratios and suggested an involvement of foetal corticosteroids in the regulation of the [fructose] of foetal plasma.9. Further evidence has been presented supporting the hypothesis that maternal induced foetal hypoglycaemia effects a relative increase in the secretion of foetal corticosteroids having an action on the chorioallantois. Also, high concentrations of maternal plasma corticosteroids may decrease the permeability of the placenta to glucose.

Renal handling of phenol red. I. A comparative study on the accumulation of phenol red and p-aminohippurate in rabbit kidney tubules in vitro. 1. The characteristics of renal accumulation of phenol red and p-aminohippurate (PAH) by slices of rabbit kidney cortex suspended in an electrolyte medium have been compared.2. It has been found that at low medium concentrations the accumulation of phenol red is about 4-5 times as high as that of PAH. Furthermore, phenol red is accumulated by the renal tissue under anaerobic conditions, in contrast to PAH.3. Experiments involving incubation of slices at low temperatures and addition of various metabolic inhibitors to the medium, indicate that the anaerobic accumulation of phenol red is due to binding to cellular constituents. This conclusion is corroborated by studies on renal homogenates from which it appears that phenol red is bound predominantly to the microsomal and mitochondrial fraction.4. The aerobic accumulation of phenol red is less susceptible to inhibition by probenecid, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and octanoate than is that of PAH. Besides, probenecid, DNP, and octanoate inhibit phenol red binding to the microsomal fraction, whereas mitochondrial binding of phenol red is unaffected by the presence of these substances.5. Fumarate and succinate affect the aerobic accumulation of phenol red and PAH to the same degree. Furthermore, fumarate, succinate, and PAH do not alter anaerobic accumulation of phenol red.6. It is concluded that probenecid, DNP, and octanoate cause more inhibition of organic anion transport than fumarate, succinate, and PAH because of lipophilic interaction with the membrane. The pronounced resistance of phenol red accumulation to inhibition by lipophilic inhibitors is probably due to the ability of the indicator dye to displace these substances from binding sites on the transporting membranes.
Continuous measurement of the energy exchanges of sheep in relation to eating and activity.
Electrolytes and water in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of the foetal sheep and guinea-pig. 1. Samples of cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (c.s.f.) and blood plasma have been obtained nearly simultaneously from foetal sheep of different ages, the foetus having been exteriorized and maintained in a normal state with respect to its blood gases and arterial pH. The brains were removed from these foetuses and also from foetal guinea-pigs after exsanguination.2. A comprehensive study has been made of the concentrations of water, chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium in blood plasma, c.s.f. and brain from foetal sheep and in brain from foetal guinea-pigs during development in utero. Maternal arterial blood plasma, cisternal c.s.f. and brain from the sheep and brain from the guinea-pig have been analysed for comparison.3. Concentrations of the ions analysed in foetal blood plasma are similar to those found by others in the sheep and other species. In the case of calcium, the results suggest an active maintenance of the concentration of this ion in foetal plasma by the placenta.4. The chloride concentration in c.s.f. at ages between 65 days and term (147 days) averaged 1.19 times that in foetal plasma, but only 1.08 at 45-50 days; the sodium concentration in c.s.f. was also slightly reduced at this time. The increase in the c.s.f./plasma ratios for chloride and sodium appears to coincide with the first development of the blood-brain and blood-c.s.f. barriers to non-electrolytes.5. Magnesium was at a slightly higher concentration in c.s.f. than in plasma at all foetal ages and did not vary with age. The concentrations of potassium and calcium in c.s.f. were high at early ages and fell to reach adult concentrations after birth: the mechanisms determining the concentrations of the various ions in c.s.f. develop at very different, largely independent, rates.6. The water content of the cerebral hemispheres of the foetal sheep was stable at 90% of the wet weight till 105 days and fell thereafter. The contents of chloride, sodium and potassium followed paraboloid relations with age. Chloride and sodium reached a peak of 62 and 81 m-equiv/kg respectively between 89 and 105 days in the sheep. Potassium was at a minimum of 65 m-equiv/kg at the same time. The content of water and these electrolytes in the cerebral hemispheres of the foetal guinea-pig underwent similar changes, the maxima and minimum occurring as in the sheep at two-thirds of the total length of the pregnancy, namely 65 days in the guinea-pig. At 46 days in the guinea-pig, chloride in brain reached 53 m-equiv/kg, sodium was 68 m-equiv/kg and potassium was 75 m-equiv/kg. In contrast to the sheep, no reversal of the sodium-potassium ratio occurred. These changes in water and electrolytes probably represent a rise, a peak and a decrease in the volume of the extracellular space of cerebral cortex, but changes in the volume occupied by a cell-type, containing much intracellular chloride and sodium, could also contribute to this phenomenon.7. The calcium content in the cerebral hemispheres of the foetal sheep remained at about 3.0 m-equiv/kg throughout pregnancy. Magnesium in the cerebral hemispheres of both the foetal sheep and the guinea-pig showed a trough in concentration during pregnancy which corresponded approximately in position to the minimum in potassium content and the maxima in chloride and sodium contents. Lowest values were 9.6 m-equiv/kg at 105 days in the sheep and 9.5 m-equiv/kg at 51 days in the guinea-pig.
The propagation of segmental contractions along the small intestine. 1. The electrical activity of the small intestine of conscious dogs, rabbits and sheep was recorded by means of chronically implanted electrodes and was related to mechanical changes in the bowel.2. A pattern of activity characteristic of segmental contractions (a prolonged series of bursts of spike activity superimposed on the basic electrical rhythm) was recorded successively at consecutive sites along the small intestine. This activity was as pronounced in the rabbits and sheep which were fed ad lib. as in the dogs which were fasted for 12 hr.3. The segmental contractions began in the duodenum and had a frequency of 15-20/24 hr. As they passed along the intestine, their velocity diminished and in the rabbits and sheep this was associated with an increased duration of activity. Most of the contractions reached the terminal ileum taking 1.5-2 hr in each of the species despite the differences in the length of the small intestine.4. The propagation of segmental contractions appears to be a normal and common activity of the intact bowel and it may have a propulsive as well as a mixing function.

The uptake and utilization of chlorambucil by lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. It has been shown that lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia do not modify the mustard group of chlorambucil, as has been demonstrated previously in Yoshida ascites cells. However, lymphocytes from patients with an unsatisfactory clinical course or poor response to treatment were able to modify the aromatic region of the drug molecule; little change occurred in the aromatic absorption of intracellular chlorambucil in patients who responded to treatment. This simple test may provide a rapid assessment of a patient's potential response to chemotherapy.
Carcinogenic activity of some benz(a)anthracene derivatives in newborn mice. Equimolar doses of 7-methylbenz(a)anthracene and 3 of its derivatives were given to newborn male and female Swiss mice. All 4 substances tested increased the risk of tumour development compared with that seen in control mice given the vehicle, arachis oil, only.7-Methylbenz(a)anthracene itself was the most actively tumorigenic of the compounds studied, giving rise to subcutaneous sarcomata at the site of injection, and multiple lung tumours and liver tumours. 7-Bromomethyl-12-methylbenz(a)-anthracene was similarly active in the lung and liver but evoked fewer subcutaneous sarcomata. 7-Bromomethylbenz(a)anthracene was seemingly slightly less active than either 7-methylbenz(a)anthracene or 7-bromomethyl-12-methylbenz(a)anthracene. 4-Chloro-7-bromomethylbenz(a)anthracene exhibited only marginal activity in that it slightly increased the risk of liver tumour development in male mice.
Results of 27 cases with hepatic metastases treated by combination chemotherapy. The results of using a standard combination of cytotoxic agents in 27 cases of secondary liver cancer are reported. A brief review of the methods available for treating hepatic metastases from solid tumours, as opposed to lymphomata, is included. The response rate depends on the site of the primary lesion. It is suggested that in patients with mammary or colorectal primary tumours, combination chemotherapy represents an advance in treatment with an objective response rate of 73% and 66% respectively in the 2 groups. The method requires no specialized equipment as neither grossly deranged liver enzymes nor jaundice are contra-indications to treatment, and toxicity is easily monitored and readily controlled.
Cancer patterns in Alameda County, California. There has been a general increase in the incidence of cancer of most major sites during the period 1960-69; this is true even when allowances are made for shifts in the age composition of the population. Improvements in diagnostic procedures may account for some of these increases but it is doubtful that they are solely responsible for the greater incidence recorded.A few sites stand out as being primarily responsible for the increase in the overall cancer incidence. Lung cancer is increasing in both males and females; the rate of increase, however, is much greater among females. It is generally acknowledged that women began smoking cigarettes at a later point in time and to a lesser extent. The pattern which has emerged indicates that females are experiencing a similar trend in lung cancer incidence to that of males. The increase in the incidence of female breast cancer is also noteworthy, although the forces producing this change can only be speculated upon. The high incidence of prostatic cancer among negroes and the increase in the incidence of prostatic cancer in whites are subjects which deserve further investigation, especially since the Alameda County experience is not duplicated in data from the Connecticut Tumour Registry. One of the most encouraging findings is that the incidence of stomach cancer appears to be declining.
Kaposi's sarcoma in Uganda: geographic and ethnic distribution. Over the quinquennium 1964-68 the crude annual incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in Uganda per million of the population was 7·9 overall, 14·6 for males and 1·1 for females. Statistical analysis indicates that the disease is most prevalent in highland areas to the west and among the indigenous Bantu tribes. There was no correlation with the distribution of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower leg, and Kaposi's sarcoma was not seen in an Indian or European during the period under review.

Progressive cerebral poliodystrophy--Alpers' disease. Disorganized giant neuronal mitochondria on electron microscopy. Three siblings who suffered from progressive mental retardation, seizures, and rigidity showed degeneration of the cerebral cortex. This was manifested by severe to complete neuronal loss with astrogliosis and microgliosis. In one child a brain biopsy was performed at the age of 3 months. The only lesion found was large disorganized perinuclear mitochondria in the neurones. The possibility that the cerebral poliodystrophy is due to an inherited mitochondrial disorder is discussed.
Lumbar intraspinal extradural ganglion cyst. A case is presented of an intraspinal extradural ganglion cyst at the L4-5 level. The clinical picture suggested a herniated nucleus pulposus at this level. A myelogram revealed a round lesion almost completely obstructing the flow of Pantopaque at the L4-5 level. A ganglion cyst with a haemorrhage into it and the surrounding tissue was removed, and surgery was followed by complete recovery.
Myotonic dystrophy: investigation of the proposed defect in guanidoacetic acid synthesis. No significant abnormality was detected in plasma levels or urinary excretion of guanidoacetic acid (GAA) in patients with myotonic dystrophy. It therefore seems unlikely that there is defective synthesis of GAA in this disorder. It was confirmed that arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGA), the enzyme responsible for GAA synthesis, is present in renal cortical tissue, but no enzyme activity could be detected in a variety of other, more accessible tissues taken from healthy controls.
Operative treatment of aneurysms and Coanda effect: a working hypothesis. The Coanda effect has been known to mechanical engineers for many decades. Consideration of this effect both by a neurosurgeon and a mechanical engineer revealed that it might be of importance during the operative treatment of intracranial aneurysms. If a jet effect were produced in the stream of blood after clipping an aneurysm, most of the flow of blood might be directed down only one limb of a bifurcation occurring in a vessel near to a clipped aneurysm. Blood might also be entrained from the other limb of the bifurcation. This boundary wall effect, which can occur without the rate of flow through the vessel being altered appreciably, could explain some of the unfortunate sequelae of aneurysm surgery which occur in the absence of any obvious cause such as postoperative thrombosis, etc. A possible mechanism for some of the complications after gradual occlusion of the common carotid artery in the neck is also proposed on this basis. Other details of how this data might be of clinical significance, together with suggestions for how to avoid fluidic effects during aneurysm surgery, are presented.
Small strokes in the carotid territory associated with a normal carotid arteriogram. Appropriate percutaneous carotid arteriography was carried out in 69 patients who presented with transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) in the carotid territory. Major abnormalities were detected in 19 which included internal carotid stenosis (nine), internal carotid occlusion (seven), intracranial aneurysm (two), and cerebral angioma (one). Forty-five patients had normal angiograms and five slight irregularity of the internal carotid artery without stenosis. The symptoms and signs pertaining to the normotensive and hypertensive groups are presented. The outcome of stroke in 35 normotensives was as follows: three died of related disease, three are severely disabled, two have slight disability, eight have minor neurological residua, and 19 are normal. Fifteen patients had a diastolic blood pressure of above 105 mm Hg and the outcome of stroke in these patients treated with hypotensive agents was as follows: two died of related disease, two have severe and two moderate disablement, four have slight disability, one has minor residua, and four are normal. The pathogenesis of TIAs in relation to the two groups and the use of anticoagulant drugs and hypotensive agents are discussed.
Impairment of memory functions after acute head injury. When memory functions are evaluated after head injury, two trends are apparent. Acute head injury patients with approximately normal intelligence demonstrate a reduced capacity to utilize structure in delayed recall relative to a control group. Furthermore, head injury patients with low intelligence demonstrate a wider memory deficit than the previous group, affecting perception and immediate recall as well. No relationship was found between severity of injury, recovery, and performance on the memory scale.
Spinal cord compression in Paget's disease. Three cases of spinal cord compression secondary to Paget's disease of the spine are reported. In two of the cases a relatively short history with pain as a prominent feature suggested initially a diagnosis of extradural malignancy. The usual clinical features of this rare disorder are discussed and the characteristic radiological findings are emphasized.
Visual evoked responses in patients with multiple sclerosis. The visual evoked response (VER) was evaluated in a series of multiple sclerosis patients and normal subjects. The data showed significant delays in wave peak latencies among the patient evoked responses. The prolonged latencies correlated closely with visual impairment; however, even patients with a previous history of visual impairment, but with no deficits noticeable on examination at the time of study, showed a delay in wave peak latencies. The results further suggest that the VER is primarily altered when there are central field defects.
Quantitative electromyography: carrier detection in Duchenne type muscular dystrophy using a new automatic technique. An automated method of quantitating small electromyographic changes, based on the ratio of action potential duration to the number of phases per potential, was applied to carriers of X-linked Duchenne type muscular dystrophy. The ratio was found to be significantly raised in a proportion of these cases.
A method for estimating the number of motor units in thenar muscles and the changes in motor unit count with ageing. A method for estimating the number of motor units in median innervated thenar muscles is described. In normal human subjects under 40 years of age, the mean and 1 SD was 253+34. The number of motor units falls with increasing age, especially after mid life, so that elderly subjects often have less than one-half the number in youth despite good strength. The cause is not known but probably includes peripheral nerve trauma and `primary neuronal cell death'.
Effect of dosage increments on blood phenytoin concentrations. Blood phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin) concentrations were measured after each dosage change in 12 epileptic patients who were given increasing oral doses of phenytoin. In each of these patients a dosage increment beyond the dosage that produced a blood phenytoin level of 6-9 μg/ml. caused a disproportionately great increase in the blood concentration of drug. This effect might be expected if the limit of the body's capacity to metabolize phenytoin were being reached. As oral dosages were increased in one patient, measurements of the rate of urinary excretion of phenytoin metabolite showed that the phase of rapid rise in blood phenytoin concentration coincided with a failure to increase the rate of phenytoin metabolite excretion. Awareness of the non-linear relation between oral dose and blood concentration of phenytoin in the individual patient, and realization that the phase of rapid rise in blood phenytoin concentration occurs through the `therapeutic' range of 10-20 μg/ml., is of importance to those who use blood phenytoin levels as a guide to the adequacy of anticonvulsant therapy.
Pathology of radiation myelopathy. After nothing the rarity of papers describing the pathology of delayed radiation necrosis of the spinal cord, the clinical and pathological findings from four cases are presented. The main pathological features are asymmetric demyelination of the lateral columns and to a lesser degree the posterior and anterior columns of white matter, with coagulative necrosis at the level of irradiation which affected the grey matter to a lesser degree. There is ascending and descending secondary tract degeneration, and poor glial response in the lesions themselves. Vascular changes, mainly hyalilne thickening of arteriolar walls, are present, but not in degree sufficient to explain the primary lesion. The discussion of the pathogenesis of the myelopathy weighs the merits of a primary vascular lesion against those of a primary effect of the radiation on neural tissue. The latter is favoured.
Vertebral artery occlusion by a cervical 'hour-glass' neurofibroma. A case of total vertebral artery occlusion by a cervical `hour-glass' or `dumb-bell' neurofibroma is reported. To the author's knowledge this is the first reported case in the English literature. A causal relationship between the arterial occlusion and the patient's symptoms has been postulated. The angiographic study of these patients is further emphasized to enhance safer and more effectual removal of these lesions.
Brain abscess due to Haemophilus aphrophilus: case report. A temporal lobe abscess due to H. aphrophilus occurred in a child of 11 years, and was successfully treated by aspiration, chemotherapy, and excision of the abscess wall. The organism is an unusual cause of brain abscess and this is believed to be the first reported case in Britain.
Two-dimensional echoencephalography with electronic sector scanning. Clinical experiences with a new method. A new form of ultrasound diagnostic possibility is presented (the electroscan). The basic principles of this two dimensional method are described. Special attention is given to the probe consisting of an array of 21 elements of piezo-electric material. The results of this method in four patients are discussed (meningioma, arteriovenous aneurysm, subdural haematoma, and a baby with hydrocephalus). The baby with hydrocephalus showed diagnostic problems which could be understood from the pneumoencephalographic findings. The electroscan method seems to offer good possibilities for the diagnosis of brain lesions, if these have a consistency different from that of normal brain tissue.

The preparation of a 'metal-free' nappy and its application to metabolic balances in children. Disposable nappies (diapers) have been satisfactorily demineralized and used for the collection of excreta from infants and young children during mineral and trace metal balances. It was possible to investigate children of both sexes without immobilization.
Rapid analysis of pregnanediol in pregnancy urine. A simple, inexpensive, and rapid method for the determination of pregnanediol in pregnancy urine by gas liquid chromatography is described. Automatic injection of the samples into the gas chromatograph allows up to 36 samples to be run overnight thus saving valuable technical time.The method described can easily be adopted for use in a routine steroid laboratory. The results obtained by this method have been compared with values obtained by the method of Klopper, Michie, and Brown (1955).

Identification and characterization of Moraxella phenylpyruvica. Eight strains of Moraxella phenylpyruvica have been isolated from clinical material in the United Kingdom, the first to be reported from this country. They were characterized, together with three strains of M. phenylpyruvica of the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC), and compared with NCTC strains of eight other Moraxella species. The strains of M. phenylpyruvica formed a homogeneous group which is readily distinguishable from other Moraxella species. Deamination of phenylalanine is not restricted to M. phenylpyruvica which, however, is urease positive and is stimulated by bile, in contrast to other Moraxella spp.
Further study of strontium selenite and selenite F broths for the isolation of Salmonella typhi. The efficiency of strontium selenite and selenite F broths in the isolation of S. typhi from 625 clinical stool specimens were compared. A total of 126 strains of S. typhi were detected. Of these, 96 (76%) were isolated with selenite F broth and 118 (94%) were isolated with strontium selenite broth. At the same time, the number of false positive isolates accruing to strontium selenite broth was less than that accruing to selenite F broth. The superiority of strontium selenite broth over selenite F broth was more obvious when relatively few typhoid bacilli were present in faeces, eg, after antibiotic therapy, or when stools had been left for prolonged periods at room termperature. In the isolation of S. typhi with strontium selenite broth, salmonella-shigella agar was found to be a better plating medium than xylose lysine desoxycholate agar.
Stimulation of growth on a deficient medium of a Klebsiella aerogenes species by sulphonamide, para-amino benzoic acid, nitrofurantoin, and some other substances. A strain of Klebsiella aerogenes is described which was unable to grow from light inocula on 5% lysed horse blood diagnostic sensitivity test (DST) agar. It was able to grow on DST agar without added horse cells and MacConkey and nutrient agar. Growth on a deficient medium was promoted by sulphonamides and nitrofurantoin as well as by para-amino benzoic acid, para-amino salicylic acid, procaine hydrochloride, thymine, and uracil.
The in-vitro activity of tobramycin compared with that of other aminoglycosides. The influence of medium composition, pH, serum, and magnesium on the action of tobramycin is compared to that on the action of gentamicin. The minimum inhibitory concentration of tobramycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin was determined for 472 strains including 19 species: tobramycin was found to be the most active against Ps. aeruginosa and kanamycin against Providence, but gentamicin was usually the most active against all other species. Ps. aeruginosa passaged on medium containing either gentamicin or tobramycin showed increased resistance to both. Sensitive strains of this species were shown to contain a small minority of cells resistant to these antibiotics, the presence of which is believed to account for the marked bactericidal synergy which was demonstrated between tobramycin and carbenicillin.
Computer listing of the effects of drugs on laboratory data. A listing of approximately 10000 effects of drugs on tests performed in clinical laboratories has been developed in a time-shared computer. The list contains a directory for matching proprietary and generic names of drugs and an explanation for the mode of action of the drug on each test. Each entry is supported by a bibliographical reference that contains the author's names, and the title of the article and journal. It is possible to search for specific ;character strings' (word or words, number, etc) to obtain all the effects of a particular drug, or all drugs that affect a particular test, or even to search for a specific explanation for an effect. The system is undergoing trial in the Department's own computer to permit of automatic correlation of the effects of drugs with laboratory data from patients in one hospital ward.
The role of operational research in clinical chemistry. This paper begins with a critical examination of the published account (Carruthers, 1970) of a pioneering study of simulation in a clinical chemistry laboratory. It next considers the basic requirements for the formal mathematical description of such a laboratory: these include the setting of criteria, the resource and input variates, and the definition of success by means of criterion variates. Investigation of criterion variates can be by direct measurement, or by a theoretical approach which may include simulation. The aims of simulation are discussed and an attempt to simulate the operation of a large clinical chemistry laboratory is described. The difficulty of constructing an overall measure of efficiency is considered in relation to improving performance within an existing framework, to evaluating new equipment such as computers on-line to laboratory apparatus, and to inter-laboratory comparisons of performance. It is concluded that complex operational research techniques, including simulation, have little to offer at least for the present, and may even lead to misleading conclusions.

A branched-chain fatty acid characteristic of M. kansasii was found in trace amounts in 2 of the 10 strains of M. marinum.
Stability of barium sulfate turbidity standards. McFarland barium sulfate standards prepared in 1952 were compared spectrophotometrically with freshly and identically prepared standards; the results were nearly identical.
Bacterial flocculation and production of poly- -hydroxybutyrate. Experiments with a number of bacteria isolated from activated sludge have shown that flocculation is independent of the presence of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in the cells. Several strains gave flocculent growth without any PHB detectable. Other strains, producing PHB in varying amounts, utilized this compound as an endogenous substrate, and after its disappearance the floc structure remained unchanged. The PHB content of various samples of activated sludge was found to be negligible.
Surface-bonded antimicrobial activity of an organosilicon quaternary ammonium chloride. The hydrolysis product of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride exhibited antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms while chemically bonded to a variety of surfaces. The chemical was not removed from surfaces by repeated washing with water, and its antimicrobial activity could not be attributed to a slow release of the chemical, but rather to the surface-bonded chemical.
Quantitation of the bioenergetics of a tuberculosis infection in chicks. Interaction of an avian tuberculosis infection with a known metabolizable energy yield of dietary corn oil in chicks was used to quantitate total host energy expenditure necessitated by the infectious process. Three trials in which two doses of inoculum were used resulted in mild and severe involvements. Trial 1 (mild) indicated that 6% and trials 2 and 3 (severe) that 96 and 93% of the energy supplied by known quantities of corn oil were utilized by the tuberculosis process. In the birds given the low level of inoculum, the degree of tuberculosis involvement, as measured by increased liver size, was correlated with increased total quantities of hepatic ribonucleic acid, monoglycerides, free fatty acids, free cholesterol, and glucose. All of these effects were observed prior to manifestations of clinical symptoms or failure of the chicks to consume all food offered.
Ecology of staphylococci in a general medical service. Investigation of the ecology of Staphylococcus aureus on the medical service of the Cincinnati General Hospital was carried out from 1964 to 1970. S. aureus was cultured from 1,442 patients. Overall, there was a progressive increase in the susceptibility of S. aureus to commonly used antibiotics, but not to penicillin. Hospital-acquired S. aureus remained highly resistant to all antibiotics except penicillinase-resistant penicillins. There was a progressive decline in the percentage of hospital-acquired infections from January 1964 to September 1969, followed by a rise during September 1969 to September 1970. No single bacteriophage group predominated among nosocomially acquired S. aureus. Major changes in the hospital environment did not appear to influence the prevalence of nasal carriage or hospital acquisition of S. aureus. This study identified the continuing problem of acquisition of S. aureus in the hospital, but no specific "epidemic strain."
Physiological and biochemical changes associated with macroconidial germination in Microsporum gypseum. A study was made of the metabolic processes associated with macroconidial germination in Microsporum gypseum. The optimum conditions for stimulation of endogenous respiration, changes in chemical composition as germination proceeds, and the uptake and synthetic fates of amino acids, glucose, and uracil were investigated. The assimilation and conversion of (14)C-glucose, (14)C-amino acids, and (14)C-uracil into the cell pool and into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material were studied during the early stages of germination (i.e., prior to germ-tube emergence). The macroconidia were not metabolically inert for any significant period of time after exposure to germination conditions. Rather, the spores rapidly assimilated all metabolites and slowly converted them into macromolecules. Investigations of the effect of inhibitors of nucleic acid and protein synthesis prior to germ-tube emergence and during early germ-tube elongation suggested significant changes in metabolism and cell permeability may be correlated with the emergence of germ tubes. Radioactivity of incorporated glucose was found to be associated largely with the lipid fractions of the macroconidia early in germination.
Thermostable acid protease produced by Penicillium duponti K1014, a true thermophilic fungus newly isolated from compost. A thermophilic fungus, K1014, newly derived from a compost was selected on the basis of protease productivity as the only one of 81 isolates to produce high levels of acid protease. The fungus was named Penicillium duponti K1014 based on taxonomical studies. It grew in the temperature range of 28 to 58 C, and the optimum was 45 to 50 C. These temperature characteristics showed that the fungus was the most strongly thermophilic of all the fungi next to Humicola lanuginosa. When P. duponti K1014 was grown on moistened wheat bran, maximal accumulation of acid protease occurred after 2 days at 45 to 50 C. The addition of ammonium salts, but not nitrate, was effective for the production of the acid protease. The acid protease of P. duponti K1014 was stable at 60 C for 1 hr and retained more than 65% of original activity after the treatment for 1 hr at 70 C at pH 4.7. This thermal property was different from those of the ordinary acid proteases, indicating that the enzyme is a thermostable protein.

Effects of haemodialysis on bone in chronic renal failure. Quantitative histological studies have been done on 80 sequential bone biopsies taken at yearly intervals from 37 patients with chronic renal failure on long-term haemodialysis treatment. Twenty-three patients were studied at the start of dialysis, and in about half the bone was abnormal. During dialysis mean osteoid area and the maximum number of unmineralized osteoid lamellae increased, and mineralized bone area decreased. The loss of bone during dialysis was also reflected in reduction of the width of individual trabeculae. These trends were less obvious in patients already established on dialysis at the time of the initial biopsy. The course of osteitis fibrosa appeared to be unaffected by dialysis.
Increasing frequency of gall bladder operations in the Bristol clinical area. In the Bristol clinical area the frequency of gall bladder operations rose by a factor of 3.4 between 1940 and 1970, the greatest increase occurring in the 1950s. The increase took place in all age groups, but was greatest in the under-30s and in men. Numerous factors affect the chance of a patient with gall stones being operated on, but a change of this magnitude suggests there has been a substantial rise in the incidence of gall stones since the second world war. This belief is supported by data from the nationwide Hospital In-patient Enquiry.
Insulin, glucose, and potassium in the treatment of congestive heart failure. A daily infusion of 500-1,000 ml of 50% glucose containing 100-120 units of soluble insulin and 100-120 mEq of potassium chloride per litre was given to six patients suffering from hyponatraemia and congestive cardiac failure resistant to digoxin and diuretic therapy. In two patients there was no response, but four showed a striking improvement with a sodium and water diuresis, a rise in plasma sodium level, and in two cases a reversion from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is suggested that insulin, glucose, and potassium given by the intravenous route in adequate dosage forms a useful adjunct to the management of severe congestive heart failure.

The role of circulating catecholamines in sweat production in man. 1. The effects of intravenous infusions of adrenaline, isoprenaline and noradrenaline on human sweating were assessed by continuous measurement of total body weight loss in normal subjects.2. All three catecholamines increased the rate of weight loss but isoprenaline was effective in a much smaller dosage than either adrenaline or noradrenaline.3. beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol reduced the response.4. The response was not abolished by collecting expired air in a Douglas bag suggesting that it was not due to an increase in respiratory water loss.5. The response was not abolished by atropine infusions suggesting that it was not mediated through cholinergic sudomotor nerves.6. It is concluded that intravenous infusions of catecholamines may elicit a small, non-cholinergically mediated sweat response in man.
Changes in regional blood flow and cardiodynamics evoked by electrical stimulation of the fastigial nucleus in the cat and their similarity to orthostatic reflexes. 1. Changes in regional blood flow and cardiodynamics were measured in anaesthetized paralysed cats during electrical stimulation of the rostral fastigial nucleus.2. Fastigial stimulation results in a graded, highly reproducible and stereotyped cardiovascular response characterized by (a) increased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures without changes in central venous or occluded vein pressure, (b) decreased blood flow and increased vascular resistance in the axillary, renal, femoral and mesenteric arteries, increased flow without any change in vascular resistance in the common carotid artery, and increase in total peripheral resistance, (c) a small increase in heart rate and myocardial contractile force, decrease in calculated stroke volume, and no change in the cardiac output.3. Changes in regional arterial flow were abolished by transection of sympathetic nerves or blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors by systemic administration of phentolamine.4. Changes in heart rate and myocardial contractility were abolished by stellate ganglionectomy or blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors by propranolol.5. No changes in pupillary diameter or retraction of the nictitating membrane were seen during fastigial stimulation with stimuli producing substantial changes in blood pressure.6. The fastigial pressor response represents a highly reproducible, stereotyped, graded, and differentiated pattern of activation of sympathetic preganglionic neurones.7. The pattern of cardiovascular effects of fastigial stimulation simulates the compensatory (orthostatic) reflex response to maintenance of an upright posture.8. Fastigial stimulation appears to excite the neural network subserving orthostatic reflexes.
Functional relationship of longitudinal and circular layers of the muscularis externa of the rabbit large intestine. 1. The functional relationship of the longitudinal and circular layers of the muscularis externa of the rabbit large intestine has been studied in a flat preparation.2. Evidence is presented that mechanical activity can be recorded independently and simultaneously from the two muscle layers of the flat preparation. Such evidence accrues mainly from results obtained from the flat preparation in response to various drugs.3. During spontaneous rhythmic contractions and during the response to pelvic (parasympathetic) nerve stimulation, both layers show similar activity, never opposite or reciprocal activity.4. In this flat preparation, the mechanism controlling the level of sustained tension (i.e. ;tone') may be dissociable, within limit, from the mechanism controlling rhythmic contractions.
Mobility and transport of magnesium in squid giant axons. 1. The Mg content of axons obtained from Loligo forbesi averaged 6.4 +/- 0.8 m-mole/kg axoplasm.2. A small patch of radioactive (28)Mg injected into an axon broadened considerably. A similar patch of (45)Ca showed hardly any broadening. The self-diffusion coefficient of Mg in axoplasm is about 2 x 10(-6) cm(2)/sec which is at least twenty times greater than that of Ca.3. Under the influence of an applied electric field Mg migrated towards the cathode. Its mobility was about half of that of Mg in free solution. This suggests that the concentration of ionized Mg in squid axoplasm is between 2 and 3 m-mole/kg axoplasm. The mobility of Mg was not changed by poisoning the axon fully.4. Mg influx and Mg efflux were roughly the same and equal to about 1 p-mole/cm(2) sec. Mg efflux was reduced by poisoning with cyanide and by replacement of external Na by choline. Removal of external K or Ca had little effect and removal of external Mg tended to increase the efflux.5. The dependence of Mg efflux on Na seems not to be secondary to changes in Ca because it persists in the absence of external Ca and in axons pre-injected with EGTA. The form of the dependence on Na ions approximates to a simple rectangular hyperbola.6. Replacement of external Na by Li or choline increased Mg influx. Mg influx was unaffected by cyanide.7. Mg efflux was reduced to an average of 15% by poisoning with cyanide or DNP. The efflux could be recovered by injection of ATP. Inhibition persisted in axons pre-injected with EGTA, showing that it is not secondary to a rise in Ca(i).8. During nervous activity there is an extra entry of Mg. For axons immersed in sea water this extra Mg entry per impulse is roughly the same as the extra Ca entry per impulse.
The effect of stretching the superior vena caval-right atrial junction on right atrial receptors in the dog. 1. Action potentials were recorded from fibres in the right cervical vagus, the receptor endings of which were localized to the endocardial surface of the superior vena caval-right atrial junction.2. Stretching the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium without obstructing venous return caused an increase in the discharge of these fibres. This increase in impulse frequency was similar to that caused by small changes in mean right atrial pressure (range 0-13.5 cm H(2)O).3. This evidence supports the earlier suggestion that stimulation of the right atrial receptors by stretching the superior vena caval-right atrial junction causes a reflex increase in heart rate.
Bile salt and non-bile salt components in bile affecting micellar cholesterol uptake by rat intestine in vitro. 1. The uptake of micellar cholesterol was measured in sacs of the upper half of everted rat intestine. Sacs of 20 cm length were incubated 1 hr in 25 ml. phosphate buffer containing fatty acid, monoglyceride and (3)H-labelled cholesterol in micellar form with the bile salt, sodium taurocholate, as the dispersing agent.2. Sacs obtained from bile fistula rats (bile duct cannulated 48 hr previously) took up more than twice as much cholesterol as did sacs obtained from untreated control rats.3. In experiments utilizing bile-deficient sacs increasing the sodium taurocholate concentration caused an increase in cholesterol uptake. Conversely, adding a small amount of whole bile caused a decrease in cholesterol uptake.4. The inhibitory effects of the bile were greatly enhanced if the bile was pre-treated with cholestyramine to remove the bile salts.5. It is concluded that bile has a variable effect on intestinal cholesterol absorption depending upon its relative concentration of bile salt and a non-bile salt component having opposite actions.6. It is suggested that the variable effect may be related to the physico-chemical dispersion of cholesterol and that the non-bile salt component may be lecithin.
